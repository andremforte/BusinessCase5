Extra:
1. A dashboard using any Python-based tool.
    - You may **NOT** use drag/drop dashboarding tools like Tableau, Power BI,
        Qlik Sense etc. Some suggestions:
        * [Plotly/Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
        * [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
        * [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)
        * ...

    - Data must be updated either real-time or whenever the dashboard is
        initialized to display the most recent data. Suggested library:
        * [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
        * **Note**: you can use any method to achieve this. There are many other
              libraries and ways to do this.

    - The dashboard must include prediction outputs based on the work
        you developed during the last business case (feel free to modify your
        previous solution or choose other classifiers or preprocessing methods
        to do so).

    - Include analyses/visualizations of the most relevant financial indicators you found.
 
2. Other features (not required but highly appreciated):
    - Easily filter financial assets by index (name actual name not required)
    - Inclusion of relevant external data into the analysis
    - Make your work available (and documented) on Github. Include a
        description of the project, intructions to run the dashboard, and
        screenshots of the final result in the README. 
    - Deploy your dashboard for public access (there are many ways to do
        this). Some examples include:
        * [Streamlit Share](https://share.streamlit.io/) (only works for streamlit apps) - Easy
            difficulty, limited learning experience
        * [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Medium difficulty, good learning experience
        * Any cloud service provider (AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure etc. contain some
            limited free resources) - Complex, excellent learning experience
